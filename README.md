# restaurantCalculator
This was a calculator I created for fun on my own time.  I created this using Java, and did it in order to get a better idea on different aspects of the language.  

The calculator will begin by opening an introduction screen saying "Sinclo's Deli".   Then it will take you to a window with three columns.  The left column lists the different prices of bagels.  The middle lists different toppings you can add in checkbox format, and the right column lists different coffees you can purchase.  The calculator will charge the price based on what is listed.  In addition, it also charges 50 cents for the first two toppings added, then an additional 50 cents per extra topping after that. 

Once the order is made, click "Calculate". It will then calculate a subtotal, multiply it by a tax rate of 8.25%, then give the grand total after tax.
